# Advent of Code 2019 - LDPL

This repo contains solutions for [Advent of Code 2019](https://adventofcode.com/2019) in [LDPL](https://github.com/Lartu/ldpl).

The code is quite ugly, I wrote it quickly and didn't clean up after getting the right answers (except removing or commenting some debug code, but I think some unused variables and packages are still there).
